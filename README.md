# student-performance-analysis
Statistical analysis of student performance to explore how socioeconomic factors affect scores.
🧩 Project Overview

This project explores whether students’ socioeconomic status has a measurable impact on their academic performance.

Using the Student Performance dataset, I examined the variable lunch as a proxy for family income:

Free/Reduced lunch → lower-income households

Standard lunch → higher-income households

The goal was to test whether there is a statistically significant difference in reading scores between the two groups.

🎯 Key Question

Do students from higher-income families score significantly higher in reading than students from low-income families?

🛠️ Methods & Tools

Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

Data Processing: filtering, grouping, missing value handling

Statistics:

Independent T-test

Effect size estimation

Visualization: bar plot comparing mean scores by lunch category

📊 Results

✔ The T-test confirmed a statistically significant difference between the two groups.
✔ Students with standard lunch achieved higher average reading scores.
✔ The bar plot visually reinforces the same pattern.

This suggests a real association between family socioeconomic status and student academic outcomes — a finding consistent with broader educational research.


🧠 Interpretation

Possible reasons behind this effect:

Access to educational resources

Quality of schools

Parental support

Time and environment for studying

Psychological and social stability
